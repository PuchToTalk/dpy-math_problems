"20 birds migrate on a seasonal basis from one lake to another, searching for food. If they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney in one season, which is 50 miles apart, then the next season they fly from lake Disney to lake London, 60 miles apart, calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons.",2200,2200,True,"The birds migrate from lake Jim to lake Disney, which is 50 miles in the first season. In the second season, they fly from lake Disney to lake London, which is 60 miles. Therefore, the total distance traveled by one bird over the two seasons is 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles. Since there are 20 birds, we multiply the distance traveled by one bird by the number of birds: 110 miles * 20 birds = 2200 miles."
"Wendy went to the dentist for a cleaning, two fillings, and a tooth extraction. The dentist charges $70 for a cleaning and $120 for a filling. Wendy’s dentist bill was five times the cost of a filling. What did Wendy pay for the tooth extraction?",290,290,True,"Wendy's dentist charges $70 for a cleaning and $120 for each filling. She had two fillings, which costs 2 * $120 = $240. The total charge for the cleaning and fillings together is $70 + $240 = $310. Since Wendy’s dentist bill was five times the cost of a filling, we know her total bill is $120 * 5 = $600. To find the cost of the tooth extraction, we subtract the total of the cleaning and fillings from the total bill: $600 - $310 = $290. Therefore, Wendy paid $290 for the tooth extraction."
"Karen is packing her backpack for a long-distance hike. She packs 20 pounds of water, 10 pounds of food, and 20 pounds of gear. During her hike, she drinks 2 pounds of water per hour and eats 1/3rd the weight of food per hour as water per hour. How much weight is she carrying after six hours?",34,34,True,"Karen packs a total of 20 pounds of water, 10 pounds of food, and 20 pounds of gear, which sums to 50 pounds initially. Over the course of six hours, she drinks 2 pounds of water per hour, totaling 12 pounds of water consumed (2 pounds/hour * 6 hours). She also eats 1/3 of the weight of water consumed per hour as food, which amounts to 4 pounds of food consumed over the six hours (12 pounds of water * 1/3). Therefore, after six hours, her remaining weight is calculated as follows: 50 pounds (initial weight) - 12 pounds (water consumed) - 4 pounds (food consumed) = 34 pounds."
Rita is reading a five-chapter book with 95 pages. Each chapter has three pages more than the previous one. How many pages does the first chapter have?,13,13,True,"Let the number of pages in the first chapter be \( x \). The subsequent chapters will then have \( x + 3 \), \( x + 6 \), \( x + 9 \), and \( x + 12 \) pages, respectively. The total number of pages in all five chapters can be expressed as:  
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + (x + 9) + (x + 12) = 95 \]  
This simplifies to:  
\[ 5x + 30 = 95 \]  
Solving for \( x \):  
\[ 5x = 95 - 30 \]  
\[ 5x = 65 \]  
\[ x = 13 \]  
Thus, the first chapter has 13 pages."
Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day. Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects.  Trisha collects 4 dozen less than Benjamin.  How many dozen eggs do the three collect total?,26,26,True,"Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day. Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects, which is 3 * 6 = 18 dozen eggs. Trisha collects 4 dozen less than Benjamin, which is 6 - 4 = 2 dozen eggs. To find the total number of eggs collected by the three, we sum their collections: 6 (Benjamin) + 18 (Carla) + 2 (Trisha) = 26 dozen eggs."
"Roy spends 2 hours on sports activities in school every day. He goes to school 5 days a week. If he missed 2 days within a week, how many hours did he spend on sports in school that week?",6,6,True,"Roy spends 2 hours on sports activities each day he attends school. He goes to school for 5 days a week but missed 2 days, which means he attended school for 3 days that week. To find the total hours he spent on sports in school, we multiply the number of days he attended (3) by the hours spent each day (2): 3 days × 2 hours/day = 6 hours."
"Cameron is printing her thesis in the school library and has 400 A4 pieces of paper. If 40% of the papers did not print out up to her desired quality and she separated them as invalid, calculate the total number of valid documents.",240,240,True,"Cameron has a total of 400 A4 pieces of paper. If 40% of these papers did not print out to her desired quality, we first need to calculate the number of invalid papers. 40% of 400 is 0.40 * 400 = 160 invalid papers. To find the total number of valid documents, we subtract the invalid papers from the total: 400 - 160 = 240 valid papers."
Burt spent $2.00 on a packet of basil seeds and $8.00 on potting soil.  The packet of seeds yielded 20 basil plants.  He sells each basil plant for $5.00 at the local farmer's market.  What is the net profit from his basil plants?,90,90,True,"Burt's total costs for the basil seeds and potting soil are $2.00 + $8.00 = $10.00. He yields 20 basil plants from the seeds and sells each plant for $5.00, resulting in total revenue of 20 plants * $5.00/plant = $100. To find the net profit, we subtract the total costs from the total revenue: $100 - $10 = $90."
Martha's cat catches 3 rats and 7 birds. Cara's cat catches 3 less than five times as many animals as Martha's cat. How many animals does Cara's cat catch?,47,47,True,"Martha's cat catches a total of 3 rats and 7 birds, which sums up to 3 + 7 = 10 animals. Cara's cat catches 3 less than five times the number of animals caught by Martha's cat. First, we calculate five times the number of animals caught by Martha's cat: 5 * 10 = 50. Then, we subtract 3 from this amount: 50 - 3 = 47. Therefore, Cara's cat catches 47 animals."
"Trey is raising money for a new bike that costs $112. He plans to spend the next two weeks selling bracelets for $1 each. On average, how many bracelets does he need to sell each day?",8,8,True,"Trey needs to raise a total of $112 for the bike, selling bracelets for $1 each, which means he needs to sell 112 bracelets in total. He has two weeks to sell them, which is equivalent to 14 days. To find out how many bracelets he needs to sell each day, we divide the total number of bracelets (112) by the number of days (14): 112 / 14 = 8 bracelets per day."
"Vanessa wants to buy a dress she saw at the mall, which costs $80, and she already has $20 in savings. Her parents give her $30 every week, but she also spends $10 each weekend at the arcades. How many weeks will she have to wait until she can gather enough money to buy the dress?",3,3,True,"Vanessa needs a total of $80 to buy the dress. She currently has $20 in savings, so she needs an additional $80 - $20 = $60. Each week, her parents give her $30, but she spends $10 at the arcades, leaving her with $30 - $10 = $20 saved each week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save the remaining $60, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she saves each week: $60 ÷ $20 = 3 weeks."
"There are 30 students in the general study hall and twice as many students in the biology hall as there are in the general study hall. If the number of students in the math hall is 3/5 times as many as the combined total number of students in the general study hall and the biology hall combined,  calculate the total number of students in all the halls combined.",144,144,True,"There are 30 students in the general study hall. The number of students in the biology hall is twice that, which means there are 30 * 2 = 60 students in the biology hall. The combined total of students in the general study hall and the biology hall is 30 + 60 = 90 students. The number of students in the math hall is 3/5 of this combined total, which is (3/5) * 90 = 54 students. Therefore, the total number of students in all the halls combined is 30 (general) + 60 (biology) + 54 (math) = 144 students."
"Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?",240,240,True,"Carlos completes the entire block in 3 minutes, which is 180 seconds. Diego runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, which is 150 seconds. If Diego maintained the same speed, he would take double the time to run the full block, which is 300 seconds. To find the average time for both racers, we need to add their times: Carlos's 180 seconds and Diego's estimated 300 seconds, then divide by 2. The average time is (180 + 300) / 2 = 240 seconds."
"A craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section, a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section, and the rest in the stationery section. They made 36 sales today. How many sales were in the stationery section?",15,15,True,"To find the number of sales in the stationery section, we first calculate the number of sales in the fabric and jewelry sections. The fabric section made a third of the total sales, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \) sales. The jewelry section made a quarter of the total sales, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \) sales. Adding these together gives us \( 12 + 9 = 21 \) sales in the fabric and jewelry sections combined. The total sales were 36, so the number of sales in the stationery section is \( 36 - 21 = 15 \)."
"Mark bought 2 pounds of tomatoes for $5 per pound and 5 pounds of apples, at $6 per pound. How much did he spend in total?",40,40,True,"Mark bought 2 pounds of tomatoes at $5 per pound, so the cost for the tomatoes is 2 * 5 = $10. He also bought 5 pounds of apples at $6 per pound, which costs 5 * 6 = $30. To find the total amount Mark spent, we add the cost of the tomatoes and the apples: $10 + $30 = $40."
"There is 80 mg of caffeine in a cup of coffee. Lisa does not want to drink more than 200 mg of caffeine per day. If she drinks three cups of coffee, how many milligrams of coffee did Lisa drink over her goal?",40,40,True,"Lisa drinks three cups of coffee, and each cup contains 80 mg of caffeine. Therefore, the total caffeine she consumes is 3 cups * 80 mg/cup = 240 mg. Lisa's goal is to not exceed 200 mg of caffeine per day. To find out how much she exceeds her goal, we subtract her daily limit from her total intake: 240 mg - 200 mg = 40 mg. Therefore, Lisa drinks 40 mg of caffeine over her goal."
"A married couple opened a savings account. The wife committed to saving $100 every week while the husband committed to saving $225 every month. After 4 months of savings, they decided to invest half of their money in buying stocks. Each share of stocks costs $50. How many shares of stocks can they buy?",25,25,True,"To determine how many shares of stocks the couple can buy, we first need to calculate their total savings after 4 months. The wife saves $100 every week, and in 4 months (approximately 16 weeks), she saves 16 * $100 = $1600. The husband saves $225 every month, so in 4 months, he saves 4 * $225 = $900. Together, they save $1600 + $900 = $2500. They decide to invest half of their total savings in stocks, which means they invest $2500 / 2 = $1250. Each share of stock costs $50, so they can buy $1250 / $50 = 25 shares of stocks."
Ms. Hatcher teaches 20 third-graders and a number of fourth-graders that is twice the number of third-graders. Her co-teacher asked her to substitute for her fifth-grade class that has half as many students as the number of third-graders. How many students did Ms. Hatcher teach for the day?,70,70,True,"Ms. Hatcher teaches 20 third-graders. The number of fourth-graders is twice that of the third-graders, so she teaches 2 * 20 = 40 fourth-graders. For the fifth-grade class, which has half as many students as the number of third-graders, there are 20 / 2 = 10 fifth-graders. To find the total number of students Ms. Hatcher teaches for the day, we add the number of students from each grade: 20 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 10 (fifth-graders) = 70 students."
Erika and her 3 siblings are drawing with chalk outside. Another 3 friends join them and ask if they can help with the drawing. Erika loses 2 pieces of chalk as they are counting and the group realizes there isn't enough chalk for everyone. Erika’s mom brings out another 12 pieces of chalk for them to share and there is now enough chalk for everyone to have 3 pieces each. How many pieces of chalk did Erika and her siblings originally have?,11,11,True,"Erika has 3 siblings, making a total of 4 children. When 3 friends join them, the total number of children becomes 4 + 3 = 7. Each child needs 3 pieces of chalk, so the total number of pieces of chalk needed is 7 children × 3 pieces/child = 21 pieces of chalk. Erika loses 2 pieces of chalk, and her mom brings out 12 more. Therefore, the original number of pieces of chalk can be calculated as follows: 
Total chalk needed (21) = Original chalk - Lost chalk (2) + Added chalk (12).
So, Original chalk = 21 + 2 - 12 = 11."
"Bob, Tom, Sally, and Jerry had dinner at their favorite pizzeria. They decide to share 2 pizzas. Bob ate half of a pizza on his own. Tom ate one-third of a pizza. Sally wasn't very hungry and only ate one-sixth of a pizza, and Jerry ate a quarter of a pizza. If each pizza is cut into 12 slices, how many slices were left over?",9,9,True,"To find out how much pizza was consumed, we need to calculate the total amount eaten by each person. Bob ate half of a pizza (1/2), Tom ate one-third (1/3), Sally ate one-sixth (1/6), and Jerry ate a quarter (1/4). To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. 

- Bob: 1/2 = 6/12
- Tom: 1/3 = 4/12
- Sally: 1/6 = 2/12
- Jerry: 1/4 = 3/12

Now, we add these amounts:
6/12 + 4/12 + 2/12 + 3/12 = 15/12

This means a total of 15/12 pizzas were eaten, which is 1 pizza and 3 slices. Since they ordered 2 pizzas (24 slices total), we calculate the leftover slices:
24 slices - 15 slices = 9 slices left over."
