"20 birds migrate on a seasonal basis from one lake to another, searching for food.

"Wendy went to the dentist for a cleaning, two fillings, and a tooth extraction. The dentist charges $70 for a cleaning and $120 for a filling. Wendy’s dentist bill was five times the cost of a filling. What did Wendy pay for the tooth extraction?","Let's denote the cost of a cleaning as \( C = 70 \) dollars, the cost of a filling as \( F = 120 \) dollars, and the cost of a tooth extraction as \( E \). Wendy had one cleaning, two fillings, and one tooth extraction. The total cost of the fillings is \( 2F = 2 \times 120 = 240 \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost of the dental services before considering the extraction is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = C + 2F + E = 70 + 240 + E

According to the problem, Wendy's total bill was five times the cost of a filling:

\[
\text{Total bill} = 5F = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ dollars}

Setting the two expressions for total cost equal gives us:

\[
70 + 240 + E = 600

Now, we can simplify this equation:

\[
310 + E = 600

To find \( E \), we subtract 310 from both sides:

\[
E = 600 - 310 = 290

- Cost of two fillings: 2 * $120 = $240

Now, we can find the total cost of the cleaning and fillings:
Total cost of cleaning and fillings = $70 + $240 = $310.

To find the cost of the tooth extraction, we subtract the total cost of the cleaning and fillings from the total bill:

The problem states that Wendy's dentist bill was five times the cost of a filling, which is \( 5 \times 120 = 600 \). This total bill of $600 must include the costs of the cleaning, the fillings, and the tooth extraction.

Number of students in the biology hall = 2 * 30 = 60 students.

Next, we find the total number of students in both the general study hall and the biology hall combined:

"Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?","To find the average time for the racers, we first need to determine the total time each racer would take to complete the race if Diego had not been tripped.

1. **Carlos's time**: Carlos completes the entire block in 3 minutes. 
   - In seconds, this is: 3 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 180 seconds.

2. **Diego's speed**: Diego runs half the block in 2.5 minutes. 
   - In seconds, this is: 2.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 150 seconds.
   - Therefore, his speed for half the block is: 
     - Distance = 0.5 (half the block)
     - Time = 150 seconds
     - Speed = Distance / Time = 0.5 / 150 = 1/300 blocks per second.

   To find out how long it would take Diego to run the entire block at the same speed:
   - Time for full block = Distance / Speed = 1 / (1/300) = 300 seconds.

3. **Average time**: Now we can find the average time for both racers:

Diego runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, which is equivalent to 2.5 * 60 = 150 seconds. If he had continued at the same speed to complete the other half of the block, we can calculate his total time for the full block.

Since he took 150 seconds to run half the block, it would take him another 150 seconds to run the other half, making his total time 150 + 150 = 300 seconds.

Erika and her 3 siblings are drawing with chalk outside. Another 3 friends join them and ask if they can help with the drawing. Erika loses 2 pieces of chalk as they are counting and the group realizes there isn't enough chalk for everyone. Erika’s mom brings out another 12 pieces of chalk for them to share and there is now enough chalk for everyone to have 3 pieces each. How many pieces of chalk did Erika and her siblings originally have?,"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

1. Erika has 3 siblings, so there are 4 children in total (Erika + 3 siblings).
2. When 3 friends join them, the total number of children becomes 4 + 3 = 7.
3. Erika loses 2 pieces of chalk, so we need to account for that loss later.
4. After losing the chalk, Erika's mom brings out 12 more pieces, which means the total number of pieces of chalk they have now is the original amount minus 2 (for the lost pieces) plus 12 (the new pieces from mom).

Let \( x \) be the original number of pieces of chalk that Erika and her siblings had. After losing 2 pieces, they have \( x - 2 \) pieces. After adding the 12 pieces from mom, they have \( x - 2 + 12 = x + 10 \) pieces of chalk.

Since there are 7 children and each child can have 3 pieces of chalk, the total number of pieces of chalk needed is:
\[ 7 \times 3 = 21 \]

Now we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 21 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 21 - 10 \]
\[ x = 11 \]

Thus, Erika and her siblings originally had 11 pieces of chalk.",True,"Erika has 3 siblings, making a total of 4 children. With 3 friends joining them, the total number of children becomes 4 + 3 = 7.

Each child needs 3 pieces of chalk, so the total amount of chalk needed is:

Erika lost 2 pieces of chalk, and her mom brought out an additional 12 pieces. Let \( x \) be the original number of pieces of chalk Erika and her siblings had. After losing 2 pieces, they had \( x - 2 \) pieces. After receiving 12 more pieces from her mom, the total amount of chalk becomes:
\( x - 2 + 12 = x + 10 \).

Setting this equal to the total amount of chalk needed:
\( x + 10 = 21 \).

Now, solving for \( x \):
\( x = 21 - 10 \)
\( x = 11 \).

This gives us the equation: original pieces of chalk - 2 + 12 = total pieces of chalk needed. Each person needs 3 pieces, so 7 people need 3 * 7 = 21 pieces of chalk. Thus, we can set up the equation: original pieces of chalk - 2 + 12 = 21. Simplifying this gives us original pieces of chalk + 10 = 21, leading to original pieces of chalk = 21 - 10 = 11.

Since they shared 2 pizzas, the total number of slices available is:

Total slices available = \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) slices.
